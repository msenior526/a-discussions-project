# Forum For'Em

A simple Sinatra AR app where you can create forums.

## Description 

On the landing page, a user should be able to signup for or login to an account. When logged in, a user can create, update, and delete their own posts. They should also be able to comment on other posts, and add a post to their favorites. A user can also delete their account. Without an account users only have access to view posts; they cannot comment on, or favorite posts.
